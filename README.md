Notebook for MOF barcode system
========

Objective
---------
Decompose a MOF into its nodes, linkers, and topology to perform additional analysis (comparisons, chemoinformatics on its components, easy topology, etc.)


TODO
----
* OpenBabel does not currently handle PBC in bond perception.  Would need to make a new ConnectTheBonds with periodic boundaries for CIFs (see mol.cpp:3534).  Also to keep the oxygen with tetrahedral bonding, etc, probably as an option to the CIF parser.


Ideas
